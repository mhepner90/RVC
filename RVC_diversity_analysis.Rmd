### Reef Visual Census Background 

Reef fish community data used in this study were collected as part of the multi-agency Reef Visual Census (RVC) [Brandt et al., 2009](https://www.coris.noaa.gov/activities/fish_monitoring_protocol/). Fish communities were visually surveyed underwater annually in the mainland FKNMS (Lower Keys, Middle Keys and Upper Keys) from 1999 to 2012, and biennially from 2012 to 2016. The Dry Tortugas region was surveyed from 1999 to 2000 and biennially from 2004 to 2016.     

The RVC uses a stationary point count method within a randomly selected 7.5 m radius circular plot with a 200m map grid from 1999 to 2012 and 100m map grid from 2014 to 2016 to optimize the observation of conspicuous and diurnally active reef fish, specifically economically and ecologically important reef fish species [Bohnsack and Bannerot, 1986](https://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NMFS/TR_NMFS/TR_NMFS_41.pdf). 

### Objective 

To analyze and compare changes in species richness, Simpson diversity, Shannon diversity and functional diversity in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) to reveal changes in temporal and spatial variability from 1999 – 2016. The indices were assessed throughout the Florida Keys, between the upper and lower keys, between habitat types, and for different levels of management (Ecological Reserves (ER), Sanctuary Preservations Areas (SPA), and Special Use/Research Only Areas (SU/RO)). 

## Diversity indicse as effective number of species 

All diversity indices were computed as effective number of species. Effective number of species is the number of equally abundance species needed to produce the observed value of a diversity index (Jost, 2006; Jost et al., 2010; MacArthur, 1965). Jost, 2006 refers to these as true measures of diversity, where prior to the conversion the diversity indices are simply measures of entropy. 

- Species Richness is the number of species in a habitat sampled  

$Richness = \sum_{i=1}^S p_i^0$  

- Simpson diversity measures the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to different species.   
$Simpson = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^S p_i^2$  

- Shannon diveristy is a measure of entropy, it is the uncertainty in the species identity of a sample  

$Shannon = - \sum_{i=1}^S p_i \log_b p_i$  

- Functional diversity (Rao's Q) is a measure of pairwise functional differences between species weighted by their relative abundances   

$Rao Q = \sum_{i=1}^S-1 \sum_{j=i+1}^S d_i p_i p_j$

## Functional distance trait based matrix (from Lefcheck et al., 2014 ChessMap.Rmd)

Gowdis computes the Gower (1971) similarity coefficient exactly as described by Podani (1999), then converts it to a dissimilarity coefficient by using D = 1 - S

```{r Functional distance matrix, eval = F}

 Questions

- Are diversity values and grouped strata related? 
- Are diversity values and subregions related? 
- Are diversity values and protection level related?

- tried using lapply, seq_along, and for( i in blank) but couldn't get it to work. Then tried melt and came close to what we want, but still need to facet by grouped strata. 

Group strata by: patch reef, forereef, and high relief
Group years by: all years combined
Subregions: UK, MK, LK

## GAM and Partial Deviances 

Build GAM model with temporal, spatial, environmental and management variables 

$y_i = \alpha + f_1(X_1i) + f_2(X_2i) + g_1(X_3i) + g_2(X_4i) + \epsilon_i$
$y_i = \alpha + f_1 (YEAR)+ f_2(PROT) + g_1(LONG, LAT)* YEAR + g_2(STRAT) + \epsilon_i$

$y_i$ is the calculated diversity for station i (response variable)
$\alpha$ is the intercept that scales the model prediction to the appropriate level of the response
$f_1 (X_1i)$ is a smoother
$g_1 (X_1i)$ is nonparametric smoother for covariates strata
$\epsilon_i$ the residual error

Temporal variables:
- YEAR: Year (categorical factor)

Spatial variables:
- latitude and longitude (continuous covariate)

Environmental variables: 
- strata (categorical factor)
- bottom depth (continuous covariate)

Management variable:
- PROT: No take marine reserve  (categorical factor)

Conitinuous covariates: modeled using non-parametric smoothing 
- thin plate regression splines with shrinkage terms (Ciannelli et al., 2008)

Categorical factors: models parametrically to determine their mean effect sizes (Zurr et al., 2009)

Fit GAM to each index separately. 

- To assess the explanatory power of each variable calculate the partial deviances by sequentially removing suites of predictors from the full gam model corresponding to indicators of space, time, environment, or management. 

- Repeat this for all possible permutations 

- Average the deviances for all models in which the predictor appeared and calculate the standard error 

- the partial deviances are the proportion of total explained deviance of the model uniquely explained by space, time, environment or management, accounting for the other predictors in the model. 

Modified from [https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-November/295324.html]

- look into mixed effect model GAMM 
- ran GAMM with each combination of variables, weight of AIC
