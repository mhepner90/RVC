Rays,"Number of ray pits per 100 m^2 area. Ray pits were counted within 1 m to either side of a 50-m transect. This is treated as a proxy of cownose ray Rhinoptera bonasus density (Hines et al. 1997). Ray pits were about 0.3 m in diameter and 10 cm deep, and could be easily seen in good visibility or detected by sweeping the sediment with hands in poor visibility. This was done once for each site, so al three samples from each site were given the same value. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crabs,"Number of crabs per 40 m^2.

Tows were completed on the same day as bivalve sampling or within a few days of sampling.  The two dredge samples closest to each individual sample were combined (summed) to provide the number in this column.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
