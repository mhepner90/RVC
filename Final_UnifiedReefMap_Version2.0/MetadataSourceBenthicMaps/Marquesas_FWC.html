This GIS data set represents the delineation of benthic habitats for the Marquesas-Quicksands area of the Florida Keys interpreted from digital, high-resolution, pan-sharpened, color IKONOS satellite imagery supplied by FWC-FWRI staff. Maps were interpreted and field calibrated by CPE with guidance from FWC-FWRI. The study area was divided into three sub-areas for field mapping purposes: Year 1 Area, Year 2 Area, and Year 3 Area. Mapping entailed a two-phased approach. First, each area was preliminarily examined using ArcMap GIS software to visually interpret the imagery and draw polygons around each observed habitat. Major and sub-categories for structure, zone, and cover components were mapped and classified according to the National Ocean Service classification scheme for south Florida and the Keys entitled: 'A Classification Scheme for Mapping the Shallow-water Coral Ecosystems of Southern Florida, version 3.2, 20 June 2008' (http:/ccma.nos.noaa.gov/ecosystems/coralreef/fl_mapping.html). The second phase included a field-based ground validation of habitat classifications using a GPS-integrated drop video system along with snorkel and SCUBA assessments.

Maps were interpreted and field calibrated by CPE with guidance from FWC-FWRI.  The study area was divided into three sub-areas for field mapping purposes: Year 1 Area, Year 2 Area, and Year 3 Area.  Mapping entailed a two-phased approach.  First, each area was preliminarily examined using ArcMap GIS software to visually interpret the imagery and draw polygons around each observed habitat.  Major and sub-categories for structure, zone, and cover components were mapped and classified according to the National Ocean Service classification scheme for south Florida and the Keys entitled: 'A Classification Scheme for Mapping the Shallow-water Coral Ecosystems of Southern Florida, version 3.2, 20 June 2008' (http:/ccma.nos.noaa.gov/ecosystems/coralreef/fl_mapping.html).  The second phase included a field-based ground validation of habitat classifications using a GPS-integrated drop video system along with snorkel and SCUBA assessments.  These data were used to calibrate the GIS line-work and classifications of habitat type.
Classification designations were first verified in the field through ground validation using in-situ methods.  These data were returned to the office and compared to preliminary mapping in GIS; any discrepancies were then corrected at this point. Future internal accuracy assessment will be conducted on each area to determine if 90-95% thematic accuracy within the Seagrass category and sub-categories is accomplished.  The deliverable will then be submitted to FWC-FWRI for review and approval before undergoing an independent, external accuracy assessment by a panel of federal, state, university, and local Florida experts.  Results of the panel review will be used to make final corrections.
     
HORIZONTAL ACCURACY:
     
1. IKONOS - Satellite images used to generate the digital data for the Marquesas mapping project were collected between March 4 and October 7, 2006. The polygons represent the distribution of benthic habitats in the Keys over this time period. The horizontal accuracy of well-defined points (clearly identifiable, immobile objects such as the corners of wharves) is within 2 m. The horizontal accuracy of continuous data (e.g., benthic habitats) ranges from 5 to 10 m, depending on the habitat class. Certain benthic features, such as patch reefs and spur-and-groove reefs, have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m. These habitats are composed of massive rock and coral formations that are stable in position over time and are resistant to all but the most powerful physical forces. Coral reefs, once established, tend to remain for decades or centuries.
2. Field points: Ground validation points were generated in ArcMap GIS. These points were then loaded into HYPACK and the field crew navigated to the point using a Trimble GPS (Global Positioning System) with correction from a U.S. Coast Guard Navigational Beacon.  Based on specifications provided by Trimble, code differential GPS positioning has a horizontal accuracy of +/- 0.25 m + 1 ppm RMS.  Code differential was visually confirmed before and during each in situ measurement.
3. Digitization: Contracted ecologists and remote sensing scientists interpreted the satellite images and digitized polygon habitats into ESRI Shapefiles using ArcGIS.  The same contractor carried out the groundtruthing activities.  FWRI staff provided support for the photo interpretation, delineation, and ground-truthing activities and for reviewing the benthic classifications.  NOAA staff digitally compiled the photographic information.  These data are preliminary and are expected to be reviewed by FWRI staff.
<br/>
Habitats were mapped according to the National Ocean Service classification scheme for south Florida and the Keys entitled: 'A Classification Scheme for Mapping the Shallow-water Coral Ecosystems of Southern Florida, version 3.2, 20 June 2008' (http:/ccma.nos.noaa.gov/ecosystems/coralreef/fl_mapping.html).  The assignment of habitat cover categories to the map is a stepwise progression from Live Coral to Seagrass to Macroalgae, etc, until the Uncolonized category is reached.  Similarly, the assignment of habitat cover sub-categories is a stepwise progression from Live Coral-Continuous to Live Coral-Patchy to Live Coral-Sparse before jumping to the Seagrass category.  The stepwise progression proceeds from Seagrass-Continuous to Seagrass-Patchy to Seagrass-Sparse before jumping to the Macroalgae category, etc.  As a result, there are cases where, for example, a habitat polygon may exhibit ~25% seagrass and ~75% macroalgae and will be classified as Seagrass-Sparse rather than Macroalgae-Patchy, even though the dominant seafloor cover is macroalgae.  All habitat Cover categories and sub-categories were mapped.
<br/>
All seafloor features visible in the imagery, except for patch reefs, were mapped to the 0.4-ha (4,047 sq m; ~1 ac) minimum mapping unit (MMU) specification.  Patch reefs visible in the imagery were mapped using an approximately 0.0625-ha (625 sq m; 0.154 acre) MMU.  Land was mapped to the 0.1-ha (1,000 sq m; 0.247 acre) MMU.  Land is represented as hard features (e.g., dock or canal edges) or the landward boundary of red mangrove extent visible in the imagery.
     
QUALITY CONTROL     
Classification designations were first verified in the field through ground validation using in-situ methods.  These data were returned to the office and compared to preliminary mapping in GIS; any discrepancies were then corrected at this point. Future internal accuracy assessment will be conducted on each area to determine if 90-95% thematic accuracy within the Seagrass category and sub-categories is accomplished.  The deliverable will then be submitted to FWC-FWRI for review and approval before undergoing an independent, external accuracy assessment by a panel of federal, state, university, and local Florida experts.  Results of the panel review will be used to make final corrections.
